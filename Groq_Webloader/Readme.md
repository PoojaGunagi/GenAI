Project Documentation: #Building End-to-End Webloader RAG Application using Groq with DataStax and Cassio, Langchain#
This project builds a web-based application that utilizes Groq for inferencing and DataStax/Cassio for data storage. Here's a breakdown of the project's functionalities and implementation steps:

Project Overview

This project builds a web application named "Web-based Loader RAG Application".
The application fetches data from a website using a library called "webbased loader".
The fetched data is then divided into chunks for further processing.
Two embedding techniques, OLA and Opia Embedding, are used to convert the chunks into vectors. Opia embedding is recommended due to its superiority.
The resultant vectors are stored in a vector database named Astra DB, which acts as a storage unit for the processed data.
Groq, an inferencing engine, is then employed to enable quick response generation even with low-configuration systems. Groq utilizes open-source LLM models and prompt templates to deliver responses.
A retrieval chain is subsequently created to facilitate data querying.
Implementation Steps

Prerequisites and Libraries:

DataStacks, Astra DB
Groq
cashio
beautifulsoup (for web scraping)
Langchain libraries (Langchain OpenAI, Langchain Core, Langchain Community)
Code Implementation:

The code is written in Python using Langchain libraries.
Necessary libraries are imported.
Web data is loaded and split into chunks using webbased_loader and a recursive character text splitter.
The create retrieval chain and create document chain functions from Langchain are used to combine the retriever and document chain for data processing.
Groq is employed for inferencing using the combined chain.
Users can query the data using the retrieval chain's invoke function with a specified input.
Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to build a web application that leverages Groq for efficient inferencing and DataStax/Cassio for data storage. The application is particularly useful for scenarios with low-configuration systems due to Groq's ability to provide faster responses through open-source LLM models.
